  <h4>Meet Prophet Muhammad</h4>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“A man from our people has risen claiming that he is a messenger sent by God… 
    He insults our gods and considers our ancestors to have been fools!</mark>
    He’s corrupted our young ones and created a divide in our community!”</p>
    <p class="normal-text">These were the words of Utbah, a resident of Mecca, to a visiting tribal chief named As’ad.</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Who is he?”.</mark> <span class="normal-text">As’ad asked.</span></p>
    <p class="italics">“He’s the son of Abdullah…someone ordinary in social status, but from a well-known family.”</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Where is he?”</mark</p>
    <p class="normal-text">As’ad continued to inquire.</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“There… But don’t listen to what he has to say, don’t even speak to him – for indeed, he is a sorcerer who will bewitch you with his words!”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">After some contemplation, As’ad decided that he couldn’t go back to his people before finding the truth about this man.</p>
    <p class="normal-text">As’ad proceeded toward the mysterious man and said,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Good morning”.</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">Muhammad, son of Abdullah, then raised his head and replied,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“God has replaced this greeting with an even better one – a greeting for the people of heaven: ‘May the Peace be upon you’…”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">As’ad responded</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Indeed, this is something new. What is it that you call for, oh Muhammad?”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">Muhammad then said,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“To witness that there is no god except God, and that I am the Messenger of God.”[i]</mark></p>
    <h4>The Call</h4>
    <p class="normal-text">
        Sixth century Arabian culture held the concepts of trust and valor in high regard. 
        As a people, the Arabs were known for their eloquence and exceptional poetry. 
        But the light of these shining qualities could not pierce through the layers of rust on many Arabian hearts. 
        Incessant tribal warfare impeded civilized development… Widespread superstition curtailed intellectual growth… 
        That age of ignorance even popularized the heinous act of burying baby girls alive![ii]
        </p>
    <p class="normal-text">Muhammad was an orphan for most of his life, 
        as his father passed away before he was born,
         and his mother died when he was five.
        Muhammad spent the remainder of his youth under the care of his grandfather and then his uncle.</p>
    <p class="normal-text">Muhammad’s upright character distinguished him, even at an early age. 
        He participated in tribal agreements which aimed at ensuring the welfare of the oppressed and defended 
        such agreements throughout his life. Muhammad worked as a forbearing shepherd and then later as a 
        successful merchant. He quickly became known as, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“The Honest One”</mark></span> and <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“The Trustworthy One”.</mark></span></p>
    <p class="normal-text">Muhammad was also a man of deep reflection. 
        If Muhammad could not be found at the workplace or at home, then he was likely busy in 
        contemplation and worship on the mountain of Hira. He climbed up to a nearby cave and would 
        spend hours, days, and even months at a time, pondering the Truth of existence. 
        Muhammad witnessed the reality that God is the radiating Sun of Existence… 
        Without the Light of God, everything in the heavens and the earth would simply be in 
        darkness – utterly nonexistent.[iii]</p>
    <p class="normal-text">One day, an angel appeared to Muhammad and said,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Oh Muhammad, read…”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">The unschooled Muhammad replied,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“And what should I read?”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">The angel then revealed the first verses of what would become known as the Quran,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Read in the Name of your Lord who created; created man from a clinging mass. Read, 
        and your Lord is the Most Generous, who taught by the pen; taught man what he did not know.”[iv]</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">Muhammad realized the grave responsibility that was on his shoulders. 
        Under God’s command, he was to deliver the most complete prescription for success – 
        the Divine Law by which God perfects the body, spirit and mind of humanity. 
        This was the remedy to his society’s ailments and the good tidings of Mercy to the worlds.</p>
    <p class="normal-text">Muhammad’s spiritual station as a prophet and messenger of God was aided 
        by the rationality of his principles, his sublime character, and the miraculous nature of 
        the newly revealed Qur’an. The eloquence, depth, and grandeur of the Qur’an baffled the Arabian
        poets. The Arabs could not fathom how any man could produce such perfection – let alone a 
        man with no formal education. As an interconnected reality of principles, 
        the Qur’an would also remain a miracle available to every nation, for ages to come.[v]</p>
    <h4>The Struggle</h4>
    <p class="normal-text">or thirteen years, Prophet Muhammad called the people of Mecca to the principles which God had revealed: 
      Oneness, Divine Guidance, and Judgment Day. He invited the world to Islam: the path of submitting oneself to the Truth. Prophet Muhammad
      prayed that people would follow God’s directives because they were founded in God’s Absolute Knowledge of what was best.  But in an idolatry-based economy,
      Oneness was bad for business. Moreover, blind loyalty to ancestors caused many Meccans to fight the changes Prophet Muhammad called for. 
      Prophet Muhammad and his fellow Muslims were persecuted and attacked until God commanded that they migrate.
      They sought refuge in the city of Yathrib (which later became known as Medina, City of the Prophet).</p>
    <p class="normal-text">In Medina, Prophet Muhammad was able to establish a society founded on the principles of Islam. 
        It was a society based on kindness and justice, with every peaceful individual.[vi] Unfortunately, the peace was short-lived, 
        as many groups forced the Muslims into defensive battles for several years. One benefit of these struggles, however, 
        was that they eventually led the Muslims back to Mecca. The Prophet and his followers entered the city without any combat.[vii]</p>
    <p class="normal-text">When the Muslim army entered Mecca, Prophet Muhammad told his former enemies,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“I say to you as my brother (Prophet) Joseph said (to his brothers):
      ‘There shall be no reproach on you today. God will forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.’[viii] ”</mark>[ix]</p>
    <h4>The Legacy</h4>
    <p class="normal-text">Before Prophet Muhammad left this world, he reminded people of the principle of Divine Leadership. 
      He emphasized that the message of Islam would not be complete without the Divine appointment of a leader to preserve that message. 
      Muhammad was the Seal of All Prophets, but the gateway of Imamah (Divinely appointed leadership) would remain open. 
      Prophet Muhammad declared on numerous occasions that Ali, son of Abu Taleb, and eleven of his descendants were the Divinely selected Imams.
      These twelve Imams would live to preserve the Message, channel Divine Mercy to the worlds and guide seekers of Truth along the path.[x],[xi]</p>
    <p class="normal-text">The legacy of Prophet Muhammad is one of Universal principle. Let us recall the account of Utbah and As’ad.
     If it were not for the insistence of As’ad to seek the truth, he may have been left in the dark about the guiding light of Muhammad.
     There may be many like Utbah in our day. Our challenge is to revive this legacy of principle in our daily lives. 
     Prophet Muhammad continues to remind humanity with the eternal Word of God,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“So where are you going? It is just a reminder for all the nations; for those of you who wish to walk straight. 
     But you do not wish unless it is wished by God, the Lord of all the Worlds.”</mark></p>

    <h4>Lady Fatimah vs Injustice</h4>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“…‘Then where do you stray?’[i] The Book of God is in your midst! Its affairs are apparent. 
      Its rulings are manifest. Its signs are dazzling. Its prohibitions are highlighted and its commands are clear… Yet, 
      indeed you have cast it behind your backs! Do you wish to abandon it? Or is there something else you wish to rule by? 
      ‘How evil a substitute for the wrongdoers!’[ii] ‘Should anyone follow a religion other than Submission to God, 
      it shall never be accepted from him, and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter.’[iii]… ”[iv]</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">With these intense words, a noble woman shook the very foundations of injustice. Those who appointed themselves to leadership were present. 
      Those who – out of fear or greed – stood by and let the conspiracy unfold were also in attendance. 
      But one righteous lady refused to be silenced by the oppression of power-mongers. Lady Fatimah’s call was ignored by many rusted hearts on that day… 
      The echo of her message, however, has continued to resonate with sound minds throughout the ages.</p>
    <p class="normal-text">After the death of Prophet Muhammad, and the dark betrayal that ensued, those who appointed themselves to political leadership usurped the land of Fadak. 
      Not only did the illegitimate rulers deny that the Prophet had granted his daughter, Lady Fatimah, the land during his lifetime, 
      but they also denied that she had the right of inheritance from her father.</p>
    <p class="normal-text">This move by the ruling party effectively prevented the divinely appointed leader, Imam Ali, and his supporters from the influential benefits of such a profitable property. 
      The usurpation of Fadak had become a symbol for the usurpation of political leadership. Lady Fatimah, thus, took a stand of principle in defense of justice. 
      History would forever record her profound wisdom and integrity.</p>
    <p class="normal-text">Lady Fatimah’s position was exceptionally distinct. Yes, she was the daughter of Prophet Muhammad. She was also the wife of Imam Ali, true successor to Prophet Muhammad.
      But beyond that, Lady Fatimah was who she was – the radiant pearl of knowledge, of piety, of virtue…and the Muslims knew it.</p>
    <h4>The Lady of the Worlds</h4>
    <p class="normal-text">Prophet Muhammad, the Messenger of God, emphasized the exalted spiritual station of Lady Fatimah on numerous occasions. 
      In one of the most evident indications of Lady Fatima’s immaculate nature, Prophet Muhammad stated,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Oh Fatimah! Indeed God is angered for your anger, and is pleased for your pleasure.”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">Since God is Just and Wise, He would only be angered or pleased righteously.
      The Prophet’s infallible words describe Lady Fatima’s anger and pleasure as indicators of God’s anger and pleasure. 
      Therefore, Lady Fatimah must not be mistaken in her anger or pleasure, under any circumstance.</p>
    <p class="normal-text">In light of this pure quality, Prophet Muhammad also said,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Oh Fatimah, aren’t you pleased to be the Lady of the Worlds, the Lady of this Nation, and the Lady of the Faithful ?”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">lady Fatimah is also known by another beautiful name: Az-Zahra. This name refers to the blooming glow of Lady Fatimah’s countenance. Her sincerity and devotion to God was manifest for all to see.</p>
    <h4>Glimpses of the Pearl</h4>
    <p class="normal-text">he magnificence of Lady Fatimah Az-Zahra cannot be encompassed by the stories of her generosity and character alone. But mentioning some of these accounts may help us gain insight into her gracious nature.</p>
    <p class="normal-text">One day, a poor man came to Lady Fatimah’s door, asking for help. At that point, Lady Fatimah, her husband, and two sons had not eaten for three days. 
      Not having any food to offer, she gave the man the necklace she was wearing and said,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Take this and sell it… Perhaps God will give you something better in exchange for it.”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">A companion of the Prophet ended up buying the necklace off of the poor man, in exchange for clothing, a horse, some food and extra money.  After having satisfied the poor man, this companion told his servant, Sahm,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Take this necklace to the Messenger of God and you are now his servant.”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">When Sahm presented the necklace to Prophet Muhammad, the Prophet said,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Proceed toward Fatimah, present the necklace to her…and you are now her servant.”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">Sahm soon relayed the Prophet’s words to Lady Fatimah. The noble Lady Fatimah Zahra took the necklace and freed Sahm from service. Sahm then began to laugh. When Lady Fatimah asked him what made him laugh, Sahm replied,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“What made me laugh was the immense blessing of this necklace! It fed a hungry man, dressed an unclothed man, satisfied a poor man, freed a slave, and then returned to its original owner!”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">On another occasion, Lady Fatimah’s older son – Imam Hassan – narrated the following,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“On Friday’s eve, I saw my mother, Fatimah, bowing and prostrating in worship until the break of dawn… I heard her continue to pray for the faithful men and women – naming each one of them. 
      But she did not ask anything for herself in prayer. So I asked,</mark></p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: rgb(238, 218, 176);">`Oh mother, why is it that you don’t pray for yourself as you pray for others?’</mark></p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">She answered,</mark></p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: rgb(238, 218, 176);">‘My son! The neighbor, then the home.’</mark><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">"</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">With these words, Lady Zahra illuminates our minds with the appropriate manner to think of fellow human beings – let alone the way to act with them.</p>
    <h4>Oppression at Her Door</h4>
    <p class="normal-text">After Prophet Muhammad passed away, Lady Fatimah Zahra cried and grieved for him continuously. The pain of losing her beloved father and mentor was only augmented by the devious plots which defied the commands of God’s Messenger.
       Lady Fatimah rebuked the mischievous planners in a segment of her famous speech, when she said,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“the thorns of hypocrisy have appeared on you! The garb of faith has worn out, those of silent perversion have spoken, 
      those of the least merit have come to the forefront and the camel of the falsifiers has growled”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">the oppressors in power did not accept Imam Ali’s refusal to pledge allegiance to them – they wanted the credibility of Imam Ali on their side. 
      They sought to force a pledge of allegiance from him.
     According to several historical accounts, the same group that was busy conspiring against Imam Ali, while he prepared the Prophet’s dead body, attacked the house of Lady Fatimah Zahra. 
     When Lady Fatimah refused to open the door for such men, they threatened to burn the door down. A simple statement made by the leader of the gang gives a glimpse of the terror that followed.</p>
    <p class="normal-text">Someone called out,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: rgb(238, 175, 175);">"But Fatimah is in there”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">Then came the dreadful shout of disregard,</p>
    <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: rgb(238, 175, 175);">“So what!”</mark></p>
    <p class="normal-text">Next, the intruders barged in by force, squeezing the blessed Lady Zahra between the door and the wall… As a result of this event, her child, Muhsin, was aborted, and her rib was broken. 
      Ultimately, the tragic episode led to <del>Lady Fatimah’s martyrdom.</del></p>
    <p class="normal-text">In accordance with Lady Fatimah’s wishes, Imam Ali buried her secretly, in the darkness of night. The Lady of Light did not want the oppressors to walk in her funeral. To this day, the exact location of Lady Fatimah’s grave is unknown.</p>

<h4>Imam Ali (p)</h4>
<p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“and I am leaving with you two weighty things. As long as you hold onto them both, you will never go astray,”</mark>
   <span class="normal-text">said Muhammad, the Messenger of God.</span></p>
<p class="normal-text">Someone from the crowd then called out, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“…O Messenger of God, what are the two weighty things?”</mark></span></p>
<p class="italics"><span class="normal-text">Prophet Muhammad then stated,</span><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“The Book of God (the Qur’an) – a connection between God and you – so hold onto it; and the other is my family (Ahl al-Bayt)…

<p class="normal-text">Prophet Muhammad continued to pray, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“O God…love those who love him, detest those who detest him…and turn the Truth with him, whichever way he turns.”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">These were the words of Prophet Muhammad on the day of Ghadir. Following the announcement, people proceeded to congratulate their Divinely-appointed leader. 
  Imam ‘Ali was the disciple who emanated wisdom, faith, and valor from every corner of his being. 
  In the sphere of intellectual thought, Imam ‘Ali was an eye of piercing insight. As Commander of the Faithful, he was closest in resemblance to Prophet Muhammad.
   In the path of justice, Imam ‘Ali’s bravery was legendary. This was the personality of the Commander of the Faithful.</p>
<h4>Unique Qualities</h4>
<p class="normal-text">Imam ‘Ali was raised by the Prophet himself and was truly the Prophet’s shadow for most of his life. 
  Even when the Prophet went out to the desert or nearby mountains, the young Imam was his companion. 
  Imam ‘Ali recalled some of these moments later on in his life, when he said, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">Every year he (the Prophet) used to go in seclusion to the Cave of Hira’, 
  where I saw him but no one else did.”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">After the Prophet received revelation in the Cave of Hira’, the first man to outwardly accept the Prophet’s message was Imam ‘Ali. 
  Indeed, Imam ‘Ali was among the very few who never believed in or bowed down to false idols – neither before nor after the advent of Islam. 
  Prophet Muhammad once said to his companions, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">The first among you to meet me at the pond 
    (in heaven) is the first among you to embrace Islam – that is ‘Ali”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">Upon the Muslim migration (hijrah) to Madinah, the Prophet paired each one of the Muslim migrants (muhajirin) with a Muslim brother from the people of 
    Madinah (anṣar). Once everyone had been paired, Imam ‘Ali came up to the Prophet with teary eyes saying, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">
    “You have not paired me with a brother”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">Prophet Muhammad then replied, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“You are my brother, in this world and the Hereafter.”</span></p>
<h4>Glimpses of the Legend</h4>
<p class="normal-text">The virtues of Imam ‘Ali are too numerous to be encompassed by this short page. 
  But mentioning some of the eternal images in Imam ‘Ali’s life may provide a glimpse into the life of a true legend.</p>
<p class="normal-text">The Battle of the Trench (Khandaq) was a notable scene for displaying Imam ‘Ali’s valor. 
  The hero of the enemies – Amro (Amr ibn Abd al-Wud) – had been taunting the Muslims, calling out for a challenger. 
  Many Muslims were terrified of the infamous Amro. But not Imam ‘Ali. 
  Each time the vicious Amro would call out for a challenger, Imam ‘Ali would ask the Prophet for permission to fight. 
  Upon the third request, Prophet Muhammad told Imam ‘Ali, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“He is Amro”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">To which Imam ‘Ali replied, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“And I am ‘Ali.”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">Prophet Muhammad then granted Imam ‘Ali permission to fight. After some words with Amro, it became clear that a fight was inevitable. 
  The two fought until Imam ‘Ali was struck and injured on the head. However, Imam ‘Ali was able to strike back and gain victory.</p>
<p class="normal-text">The Muslims were relieved that the invaders had just lost their wicked icon. Prophet Muhammad commented on the incident by saying,</p>
<p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“The challenge that ‘Ali met Amro with on the Day of the Trench (Khandaq) is greater than the deeds of my entire nation until the Day of Judgment.”</mark></p>
<p class="normal-text">While Imam ‘Ali was a courageous defender of truth on the battlefield, he was also a profoundly wise and patient leader. 
  Imam ‘Ali carefully picked his battles without ever sacrificing his principles. 
  After Prophet Muhammad passed away, many of the prominent companions disobeyed God’s directives to follow Imam ‘Ali as their leader. 
  Instead, different political leaders were chosen by some of the companions. 
  In order to safeguard the Muslim nation from civil strife and self-destruction, Imam ‘Ali opted not to bear arms against the illegitimate rulers. 
  Imam ‘Ali continued to advise these rulers, insofar as the greater benefit of serving the truth was concerned.</p>
<p class="normal-text">Unfortunately, even when the majority of Muslims pledged allegiance to Imam ‘Ali years later, 
  dissident groups forced Imam ‘Ali into battle, and internal conspiracies prevented him from executing all of his reformatory plans. 
  Eventually, an assassin struck Imam ‘Ali with a poison-laden sword, while he was in prayer at the Mosque of Kufah. 
  In the coming nights, many of the poor stopped receiving the charity they had awaited so anxiously. 
  They realized that the mysterious angel who came to give them sadaqah at night had been none other than Imam ‘Ali.</p>
<h4>The Path of Eloquence</h4>
<p class="normal-text">Some of Imam ‘Ali’s words of wisdom have been preserved and gathered in a collection known as the Path of Eloquence (Nahj al-Balaghah). 
  Here is a taste of some of Imam ‘Ali’s words describing God, in the Sermon of Skeletons (Khutbah al-Ashbah):</p>
<p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“He is Powerful, such that when imagination shoots its arrows to comprehend the extremity of His power, and mind, 
  making itself free of the dangers of evil thoughts, tries to find Him in the depth of His realm, 
  and hearts long to grasp the realities of His attributes and openings of intelligence penetrate beyond description in order to secure knowledge about His Being, 
  crossing the dark pitfalls of the unknown and concentrating towards Him, He would turn them back. 
  They would return defeated, admitting that the reality of His knowledge cannot be comprehended by such random efforts, 
  nor can an iota of the sublimity of His Honor enter the understanding of thinkers”</mark></p>
<p class="normal-text">Another excerpt of Imam ‘Ali’s words teaches us a lifelong lesson on how to deal with others, especially if we find ourselves in a position of authority. 
  In a letter to Malik al-Ashtar, the Governor of Egypt –– Imam ‘Ali wrote the following:</p>
<p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“…Remember, Malik, that amongst your subjects there are two kinds of people: those who have the same religion as you have – they are brothers to you,
   and those who have religions other than yours – they are human beings like you. Men of either category suffer from the same weaknesses and disabilities 
   that human beings are inclined to, they commit sins, indulge in vices either intentionally or foolishly and unintentionally, without realizing the enormity
  of their deeds. Let your mercy and compassion come to their rescue and help in the same way and to the same extent that you expect God to show mercy and 
  forgiveness to you…”</mark></p>

  <h3>Words of Wisdom from Imam Hasan ibn Ali, al-Mujtaba (p)</h3>
  <p class="normal-text">A person once asked Imam al-Hasan (p) why we hate death. He answered, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Because you have demolished your hereafter and constructed your world 
    (at the expense of demolishing your hereafter), and you hate to move from construction to destruction.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“The soundest of hearts is the heart that is pure of suspicions.”</mark></p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“The peak of intelligence is to treat people with beautiful conduct.”</mark></p>
  <h3>Salient Features of Imam Hasan ibn Ali, al-Mujtaba (p)</h3>
  <h4>1. The Grandson of the Prophet</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Hasan (p) was the beloved grandson of the Prophet (pbuh&hp), and the two shared a special bond. The love between the pair was seen in both private and public. 
    No matter if the Prophet had other affairs or was tired, he always found the time to play with his grandsons, both Imam Hasan (p) and his younger brother Imam Hussain (p). 
    Imam Hasan (p) would chase the Prophet around in circles, and they would be heard laughing by all those who were around. 
    If Imam Hasan (p) wanted to play with the Prophet during his prayers, even then the Prophet never scolded his grandson. 
    He would carry Imam Hasan (p) on his back and say <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“O God! I love him, so You also love him!”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">When the Prophet passed away, Imam Hasan (p) was still a young boy of seven years who missed playing with his grandfather. 
    His youthful age did prevent the Prophet from recognizing his lofty station in the eyes of Allah. The Prophet was often heard praising Imam Hasan (p). 
    The Prophet would praise both grandsons when he repeated, “Hasan and Hussain are the Masters of the Youth in Paradise.”4 The Prophet would continue in further praise, 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“All the people of paradise are youths.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">In other words, Imam Hasan (p) is a leader among all the inhabitants of paradise. Through such narrations, the Prophet was remarking on the great qualities which Imam Hasan (p) manifested. 
    There is no doubt that Imam Hasan (p) was the most qualified individual for the Divinely appointed post of Imam after his father Imam Ali (p).</p>
  <h4>2. al-Mujtaba – The Chosen One</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Hasan ibn Ali, al-Mujtaba (p) was the second Imam, but what made him the Chosen One, al-Mujtaba? Imam Hasan (p) lived with his father for about thirty years after the Prophet’s passing.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">During Imam Ali’s political leadership, Imam Hasan (p) supported the establishment of justice with sacrifice and relentless effort. Before Imam ‘Ali (p) was martyred, he said:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“My son, the Messenger of God had commanded me to have you carry out my will (as successor), and turn my books and weapon over to you – just as he had me carry out his will (as successor) and turned his books and weapon over to me”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">He was divinely selected to be the successor of Imamate through the Prophet. He was also the perfect embodiment of what it means to be an Imam. </p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Hasan (p) possessed certain qualities and characteristics that set him apart from other individuals. He was known for his generosity, kindness, and willingness to help others. 
    He followed his mother’s saying, <span class="italics">“Neighbors before ourselves,”</span> perfectly. If anyone was ever hungry or in need of food, Imam Hasan (p) always had a table with a spread of food ready for those who needed it. 
    Such was the generosity and eagerness to take care of all those who came seeking help or guidance.</p>
  <h4>3. The Struggle Against Mu’awiyah</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Hasan (p) was both the spiritual and political leader of his time. Perhaps one of the biggest political markers of his Imamate was his struggle against Mu’awiyah, 
    the leader of the military campaigns against the innate message of Islam and all the values Imam Hasan (p) stood for. </p>
  <p class="normal-text">Despite the oppression of Mu’awiyah, Imam Hasan’s army was not in the state to fight another war. Different groups within the military were divided on their loyalties. 
    Some fought alongside Imam Hasan (p) simply because he opposed Mu’awiyah – they felt little devotion to Imam Hasan in any case. 
    Others were Imam Hasan’s supporters out of blind loyalty to their tribal chiefs who had pledged allegiance to the Imam. 
    Then there were the few who followed Imam Hasan (p) with the awareness that he was the true successor to the Prophet.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">The vast majority of Imam Hasan’s military did not have the determination to fight against Mu’awiyah. 
    For example, Imam Hasan (p) appointed one of his officers to lead a division of 12,000 troops.
   A short while after, the officer had been bribed and turned over – along with 8,000 troops – to Mu’awiyah’s camp.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Hasan (p) was left with a military of shaken morale, subsequent betrayals within his own camp, and a ruthless enemy waiting to take advantage of the situation. 
    Imam Hasan (p) knew that the best way to preserve the message of the Prophet and minimize the loss of life was by agreeing to a treaty with Mu’awiyah. 
    When Imam Hasan (p) was questioned about his decision, he said,</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“By God, I have not submitted the authority to him (Mu’awiyah). However, I have not found supporters. 
    If I had supporters, I would have fought him day and night until God judges between us. But I knew the people of Kufah (the governing city at the time) and their predicament. 
    The corrupt among them would not reform – they had no loyalty or responsibility in words or actions… They say that their hearts are with us, but, indeed, their swords are turned against us!”</mark></p>
  <h4>Some key terms of the treaty were as follows:</h4>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Mu’awiyah would hold political authority, on the condition that he acts in accordance with the Book of God and the Prophetic Tradition.</li>
    <li>Imam Hasan (p) would resume political authority after Mu’awiyah. If anything happened to Imam Hasan, Imam Hussain would assume political authority, and Mu’awiyah had no right to appoint anyone.</li>
    <li>Cursing Imam Ali (p) and supplication against him in prayers would have to stop. Only good would be mentioned regarding Imam Ali (p).</li>
    <li>Money in the treasury would be distributed among the children of those men who were martyred while fighting alongside Imam Ali (p) in different battles against Mu’awiyah and other enemies.</li>
    <li>People were to be safe, no matter where they were in Syria, Iraq, Hejaz, or Yemen. Mu’awiyah would not persecute others – including the followers of Imam ‘Ali (p) – based on past conflicts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal-text">Mu’awiyah wrote down these terms himself and sealed the document. He swore to abide by it in front of all the chiefs in his region. But he did not abide by it.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Instead, Mu’awiyah proceeded with a policy of terrorism and persecution against anyone who outwardly affiliated with Imam ‘Ali’s family. 
    Ironically, it was only after seeing the ugliness of Mu’awiyah’s rule that many citizens awakened to the righteous demands for justice for which Imam Hasan called. 
    Imam Hasan’s wise decisions gave way to a mass revival that would culminate years later.</p>

    <li>Imam Hussain (p) is reported to have said: <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Whoever wishes to have an increased life span, an increased sustenance,

  </ul>
  <h3 id="red">Salient Features of Imam Husayn ibn Ali (p)</h3>
  <h4 id="red">The Second Grandson of the Prophet </h4>
  <p class="normal-text">Similar to his older brother, Imam Husayn (p) also had a very close and loving relationship with his grandfather, the Prophet. 
    When Imam Hussain (p) came toward Prophet Muhammad (pbuh&hp), the Messenger of God said, 
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Welcome O Aba ‘Abdillah (Hussain), O you who is the adornment of the heavens and earth!”</mark></span>
  Another person present was taken aback and asked, 
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“How can anyone be the adornment of the heavens and earth other than you, O Messenger of God?”</mark></span> 
  Prophet Muhammad (pbuh&hp) replied: 
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“… (I swear) by the One who sent me as a Prophet with Truth that the remembrance of Hussain, the son of ‘Ali, is greater in heaven than it is on earth. 
  On the right of God’s throne, he (Imam Hussain) is written as ‘the lamp of guidance and the ship of salvation’”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">On countless occasions, the Prophet would praise Imam Hussain, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">
    “Hussain is from me, and I am from Hussain – God loves those who love Hussain.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Besides the Prophet’s love and affection for Imam Hussain (p), the Prophet also instilled within him the best of qualities and mannerisms. 
    Together, the pair would recite the words of God, and the Prophet would teach him different surahs from the Quran.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">During these years, the following narration best encapsulates the divine and superior nature of Imam Hussain from his youth, growing up under the Prophet: 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Hussain Ibn Ali, son of the dear daughter of the holy Prophet, enjoys nobility, dignity, and wisdom. 
    His distinction is beyond the ability of the pen to write, and the tongue to speak. He is an ocean of knowledge, which has no shore. 
    He is the suitable person for the post of caliphate. He enjoys a brilliant record, an age full of experience, a glorious background, and honorable kinship. 
    He is very affectionate to the youngsters and kind to the elders.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">After the Prophet’s death, when Ali sought out the Prophet’s wisdom, he turned to Hussain. 
    Imam Ali (p) held his son’s face in his hands and looked into his eyes. Then, he exclaimed, 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“How closely you resemble the Prophet’s shape and complexion!”</mark></span> 
     Hussain was the image of the Holy Prophet, both in terms of looks and character. 
    It is clear that Imam Hussain embodied every aspect of spirituality from the Prophet, Imam Ali, and Lady Fatima Zahra. 
    Hussain was the spiritual and physical manifestation of his forefathers, and he was raised under the light of their divine guidance. </p>
  <h4 id="red">Du’a and Knowing God </h4>
  <p class="normal-text">Besides his close relationship with the Prophet, Imam Ali, and Imam Hasan, Imam Hussain is a profound leader based on his own merit.
    Through Imam Hussain’s profound wisdom and unmatched devotion, he taught, and continues to teach, generation after generation about the way to know God. 
    In the following prayer by Imam Hussain, known as Dua Arafah, Imam Hussain communicates with God.</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“My Lord! Going back and forth between the effects (which lead to You) entails a distanced visit; 
    So gather me unto You through a service that will lead me to You! How can You be proven through that which is in need of You in its very existence? 
    Does something besides You have a manifestation that is not Yours such that it would be the one to manifest You?”</mark></p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“When have You ever been hidden, such that You need a proof to show You? When have You ever been distant, 
    such that the effects are what lead to You? Blind is the eye which does not see You, 
    Ever-Watchful over it! It has lost the deal – that of a servant for whom You did not set a share in Your Love”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">This excerpt represents a peek into the beauty that motivated Imam Hussain (p) at the level of principles. 
    It was with this certainty in knowing God that Imam Hussain (p) made his every move. 
    This deep connection to God enabled the third infallible Imam to lead and strive in defense of the principles that represent humanity.</p>
  <h4 id="red">The Stand Against Yazid</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">With Muawiyah death, Yazid quickly assumed the political throne and attempted to force his will upon Imam Hussain (p). 
    Imam Hussain (p) again rejected the sacrilegious Yazid as a ruler and the system of monarchical despotism established by Muawiyah. 
    As the Imam prepared for a stand against tyranny, Imam Hussain (p) also received letters from the people of Kufah, who wrote, 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Furthermore; the gardens have greened and the fruits have ripened; So if you wish, then come toward (us) – troops are assembled for you (to lead).”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Regardless of what support Imam Hussain (p) was to receive, he knew that an eternal stand against the camp of dehumanization was inevitable. 
    The betrayal experienced by Prophet Muhammad, the injustice suffered by Imam Ali and Lady Fatima, the treachery directed toward Imam Hassan, 
    and the murder of innocent life, culminated in Imam Hussain’s movement. Before departing toward Iraq, Imam Hussain (p) wrote the following in his will:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Indeed, I did not leave out of self-conceit or vanity; neither to cause corruption nor oppression. 
    Rather, I left to seek reform in the nation of my grandfather (Prophet Muhammad) and father (Imam Ali). 
    I wish to promote virtue and prevent vice. So as for those who accept me in accepting the Truth, indeed God is of greater right over the Truth. 
    As for those who reject, I will be patient until God judges between me and the people (who reject), with Truth, and He is the Best of Judges.”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Hussain (p) led a group of his close family members and companions toward Iraq. 
    Even women and young ones passionately chose to join the third Imam in his epic struggle. 
    On the way, Imam Hussain (p) was informed that his emissary to Kufah had been executed and that the people of Kufah had deserted him. 
    Upon hearing the news, Imam Hussain (p) said, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Our Shia (supporters) have deserted us. Those of you who would like to leave may do so freely, without fault.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Those who remained committed to Imam Hussain’s mission were of the highest caliber in intellect, faith, and love. 
      The tragic and heroic events that followed cannot be described adequately in these limited lines. 
      However, every year, across the globe, the principled struggle of the noble 72 defenders – led by Imam Hussain – has been commemorated. 
      The elegies, the reflections, the tears, and the principled actions of sincere devotees pronounce a glimpse of Imam Hussain’s universal 
      message of truth, justice, and love for humanity.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">The holy month of Muharram was a month in which bloodshed was considered forbidden among the Arabs, even before the advent of Islam. 
    However, on the tenth day of that month, on the day of Ashura, in the land of Karbala, sacred blood was shed. 
    Imam Hussain (p) was martyred at the hands of heartless terrorists – criminals who falsely claimed to follow Prophet Muhammad (pbuh&hp). 
    Little did they know that Imam Hussain’s revolution had only just begun.</p>

    <h4>Ali ibn Hussain (p) – The Best of Worshippers</h4>
    <p class="normal-text">Hisham, a prominent political figure, struggled to push through the sea of pilgrims in an attempt to reach the holy black stone. 
      His attempts were unsuccessful. Suddenly, a man who was undeniably pious approached. 
      The pilgrims swiftly made way for the devout master until he reached the stone.</p>
    <p class="normal-text">Upon seeing this, a crowd near the politician asked, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Who is that?”</mark></span></p>
    <p class="normal-text">Hisham responded dismissively, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“I don’t know him,” even though he did.</mark></span></p>
    <p class="normal-text">The celebrated poet, Farazdaq, heard the exchange and declared, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“But, indeed, I know him. This is ‘Ali, the son of Hussain – Zayn al-Abidin (the Finest of Worshippers).”</mark></span>
       Farazdaq then proceeded to recite some verses of poetry on the spot:</p>
      <br>
       <pre class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">
    “This is the one whose footsteps are known to the soil

     He is known by the House of God, the sanctuary and its surroundings

     This is the son of God’s finest servants, in their entirety

     This is the pious, the untainted, the pure, and the beacon

     This is the grandson of (Lady) Faṭimah, if you do not know who he is

     With his great-grandfather, the Prophets of God have been concluded

     And your utterance, “Who is this?” does no harm to him

     The citizens and foreigners alike know the one you have denied…”</mark></pre>
  <h4>The Fourth Imam</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">He was the only adult male to have survived the onslaught of ‘Ashura’. 
    His role would reach beyond the plains of Karbala’. Imam ‘Ali, the son of Hussain, 
    lived on as the voice of the revolution, even in the tyrant’s very own palace. 
    Imam ‘Ali Zayn al-Abidin was the fourth immaculate Imam.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Hussain did not allow Zayn al-Abidin to fight during the battle of ‘Ashura’, due to his illness and because he 
    needed to survive as the Divine representative on earth. For indeed, when Imam Hussain was asked about who the 
    authority would go to if he passed, he said, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“To ‘Ali, this son of mine. He is the Imam, and the forefather of the (following) Imams.”</mark></span></p>
  <P class="normal-text">Imam Zayn al-Abidin had a long journey ahead of him. A journey of spreading awareness and sparking an awakening. 
    The fourth infallible Imam struggled, but not on the battlefield as Imam Hussain did. 
    The struggle was the same struggle – the struggle of Awareness, Truth, and Love. But the methods and tools varied.</P>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Zayn al-Abidin pursued his struggle by speaking out, teaching, and praying…Yes, by praying. 
    Not the prayer of one who has given up and surrendered to injustice or ignorance. 
    Rather, the prayer of one who encoded the secrets of awakening into the words of his prayer. 
    The Imam taught of rights and detailed the prescription required for true balance. 
    He educated, inspired and invigorated the people. He revived true life by preparing the hearts of the people to ignite with the fire of purpose.</p>
  <h4>The Aftermath of Ashura</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">After ‘Ashura’, Imam Zayn al-Abidin led the caravan of women and children who were taken as prisoners of war. 
    In shackles, along with the noble Lady Zaynab, Imam Zayn al-Abidin challenged injustice. When threatened with execution, the Imam stated:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Is it through killing that you threaten me…?! Don’t you know that getting killed has become a habit for us (the Imams), 
    and that our honor is in martyrdom?!”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">In the court of the tyrant Yazid, Imam Zayn al-Abidin spoke out in front of the crowd. 
    He announced who he was and what had happened to his family, the protectors of faith. 
    As the Imam eloquently spoke, the people present were spontaneously awakened to the tragedies that had come to pass. 
    The entire court was shaken in an outburst of tears and emotional cries.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Yazid feared that the crowd would turn against him so he ordered that the call to prayer be made. 
    When the call to prayer reached the phrase, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God,”</mark></span> Imam Zayn al-Abidin turned to Yazid and said:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“This Muhammad, is he my grandfather or your grandfather, O Yazid? If you say that he is your grandfather, 
    you have lied and rejected the truth. And if you say that he is my grandfather, then why did you kill his family?”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">As people heard these words, they saw through Yazid’s deception. 
    The court was overtaken by commotion and division. 
    With Imam Zayn al-‘Abidin’s words, people saw the ugly face of evil that Yazid represented.</p>
  <h4>Prayers from al-Sahifah al-Sajjadiyyah</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">A famous compilation of Imam Zayn al-‘Abidin’s prayers is called al-Sahifah al-Sajjadiyyah (The Book of the One in Frequent Prostration). 
    The title refers to Imam Zayn al-‘Abidin’s devotional worship in which he constantly humbled himself before God. 
    This compilation of prayers can be regarded as fuel for spiritual development.
    Reflecting on the words of Imam Zayn al-Abidin in relation to God creates a healing, motivational, and uplifting effect, to say the very least. 
    Consider, for instance, the following excerpt from the Supplication in Asking for Release from Sins:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“…so here I am, O Lord, thrown down before You! I am the one whose back is weighed down by mistakes! 
    I am the one whose lifetime has been consumed by sins! I am the one who – with his ignorance – disobeyed You, while You did not deserve that from him!”</mark></p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“O God, would You have mercy on the one who prays to You, such that I should exert myself in prayer? 
    Or would You forgive the one who cries to You, such that I should hurry to cry? 
    Or would You pardon the one who smears his face (in the dirt) out of humility before You? 
    Or would You free from need the one who complains to You of his poverty, with confidence (in You)?”</mark></p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“O God, do not disappoint the one who finds no Giver other than You… Do not let down the one who cannot be freed from his need for 
    You through anyone but You…O God, bless Muhammad and his family, and do not turn away from me – for I have turned to 
    You…Do not deprive me, for I have sought after You…and do not confront me with rejection, for I have stood before You…”</mark></p>
    <h4>Treatise on Rights</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">The fourth infallible Imam is also known to have written a comprehensive treatise on rights. 
    In this unique treatise, Imam Zayn al-Abidin eloquently discusses the rights of each faculty the human being has control over, 
    then the rights of various members of society, spanning from a person’s children to the nation’s ruler. 
    Here is a brief selection on the right of one’s mother:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“The right of your mother is that you know she carried you where no one carries anyone, 
    she fed you from the fruit of her heart that which no one feeds anyone, and she protected you…with all of her organs…
    She did not mind going hungry as long as you ate, if she was thirsty as long as you drank, 
    if she was bare as long as you were clothed, if she was in the sun as long as you were in the shade…
    You will not be able to show her gratitude except through God’s help and granting of success.”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Zayn al-‘Abidin’s educational and motivational presence threatened the rulers of his day. 
    It was during the reign of Hisham – yes, the politician from the anecdote – that the Imam was assassinated. 
    Hisham’s relative, Walid, had the holy Imam poisoned. While Imam Zayn al-‘Abidin’s noble qualities cannot be encompassed, 
    knowing of even a few seeds which the fourth Imam planted tells us stories of blossoming greatness.</p>

<ul class="key-info">
  <li>Name: Muhammad</li>
  <li>Title: al-Baqir (Splitter of Knowledge)</li>
  <li>Kunya: Abu Ja’far</li>
  <li>Father: Ali ibn Hussain, Zayn al-Abidin (Peace be upon him)</li>
  <li>Mother: Fatimah bint al-Hasan</li>
  <li>Born: 1st Rajab, 57 AH/676 CE in the Holy City of Madinah</li>
  <li>Died: 7th Dhul-Hijjah, 114 AH/733 CE, after being poisoned by the Abbasid Caliph Hisham</li>
  <li>Age at Martyrdom: 57</li>
  <li>Period of Imamate: 19 years</li>
  <li>Buried: Al-Baqi’ cemetery, Madinah</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Splitter of Knowledge</h4>
<p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“O Jabir, you will live to see my descendant Muhammad, son of ‘Ali, son of Husayn, 
  son of ‘Ali… The one who is known in the (original) Torah as ‘al-Baqir’ (the Revealer of Knowledge). 
  When you see him, deliver to him my greetings of Peace…”</mark></p>
<p class="normal-text">These were the words of Prophet Muhammad to the righteous companion Jabir al-Ansari. 
  Many years later, Jabir was an old man going on a visit to see the fourth Imam, Zayn al-Abidin. 
  As he entered the Imam’s home, he saw an intriguing young boy. 
  Jabir began to examine the young boy… After which, he said, 
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“By the Lord of the Ka’bah, (I see in him) the qualities of God’s Messenger (Prophet Muhammad)…”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">Jabir then asked Imam Zayn al-Abidin about who the boy was. Imam Zayn al-Abidin responded,
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“This is my son and the commander of affairs after me – Muhammad al-Baqir.”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">Upon hearing these words, Jabir humbled himself before the young boy, kissed him and said, 
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“…O Descendant of God’s Messenger, accept the greetings of peace from your forefather. 
    Indeed, the Messenger of God sends greetings of peace to you!”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">Tears started to run down the young boy’s face, as he responded, 
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“O Jabir, may peace be upon my forefather – the Messenger of God – for as long as the heavens and earth last – and upon you as well, 
  O Jabir, for delivering this greeting of peace…”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">The Seal of All Prophets had prophesized that this young boy, Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, would unlock the chests of knowledge. 
  He would extract priceless treasures for the generations and further the spiritual advancement of humanity.</p>
<h4>The Fifth Imam</h4>
<p class="normal-text">During Imam Zayn al-Abidin’s lifetime, he was asked, 
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Who will be the Imam after you?”</mark></span> Imam Zayn al-Abidin replied,
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Muhammad, my son – he will reveal and expand knowledge.”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth immaculate Imam, was a young child during the tragedy of ‘Ashura’. 
  The memories of his grandfather, Imam Husayn, stuck with him throughout his life. 
  He grew up in the spiritually enlightening care of his father, Imam Zayn al-Abidin.</p>
<p class="normal-text">The fifth Imam became known – by friend and foe, alike – for his knowledge, piety and virtue. 
  Imam al-Baqir revealed more insight about the Islamic sciences than any other counterpart since the time of Imam Hasan and Imam Husayn. 
  He paved the way for the establishment of a massive Islamic university, which would reach its peak of development during the following Imam’s time.</p>
<p class="normal-text">Many of Imam al-Baqir’s contemporaries had written about his scholarly status. 
  These prominent scholars were from different schools of thought. 
  For instance, a notable contemporary by the name of ‘Abdullah ibn Ata’ stated, 
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“I have never seen scholars, in the presence of anyone, (seem) lesser (in knowledge) 
  than they did in the presence of Abu Ja’far (Imam al-Baqir) – Muhammad, son of ‘Ali, son of Husayn… 
  Indeed, I saw Hakam ibn ‘Utaybah, with all of his (scholarly) splendor among the people, (look) like a boy in the 
  presence of his teacher – when he was in the presence of (Imam al-Baqir).”</mark></span></p>
<h4>In the Capital of Tyranny</h4>
<p class="normal-text">Often times, there are those who may think of <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“religion”
</mark></span> and <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“being religious”</mark></span> as something restricted to 
  houses of worship – prayers, fasting, sermons, etc. But Imam al-Baqir reminds us of a very different aspect of religion…</p>
<p class="normal-text">On a hot, scorching day, there was a man who saw Imam Muhammad al-Baqir working. 
  The burden of hard work was apparent on the Imam, as he leaned on a couple of servant helpers. 
  The man started to think to himself, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Praise be to God! A chief among the chiefs of Quraysh (a major tribe) – at this hour, 
  in this condition – seeking after the worldly (life)?! Indeed, I shall admonish him…”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">The man approached Imam al-Baqir and greeted him. Dripping with sweat, the Imam responded to the greeting. 
  The man then started to admonish, saying, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“May God improve you… A chief among the chiefs of Quraysh – at this hour, 
  in this condition – seeking after the worldly (life)?! What if your time (of death) comes while you are in this state? What would you do?”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">The Holy Imam responded, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“If death comes to me while I am in this state, 
  it would come to me while I am in (a form of) obedience to God – the Exalted, the Glorious. 
  Through this (state of work), I provide for myself and my family to be free from needing you and other people. 
  Indeed, I would be afraid, rather, if death comes to me while I am in (a form of) disobedience to God.”</mark></span>
   The man then conceded, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“You have spoken truthfully, may God grant you Mercy… 
    I had wanted to admonish you, but you admonished me!”</mark></span></p>
<h4>The True Shia</h4>
<p class="normal-text">Imam Muhammad al-Baqir’s words of wisdom can spark the light of deep reflection within us. 
  While these short lines can only relate a few words, a brief excerpt might renew our desire to seek further insight. 
  In discussing the true meaning of being a Shia Muslim, Imam al-Baqir said the following, 
  <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“…Does the one who claims to be of the Shia think it is enough to (simply) speak of loving us, 
  Ahl al-Bayt (the Prophet’s family)? By God, our Shia are only those who are mindful of God and obey Him. 
  They were known…only (in light of their) modesty, humility, trustworthiness, abundant remembrance of God, fasting, prayer, 
  honoring parents, caring for neighbors, the poor, people in need, those in debt, and orphans… 
  (they were known for their) truthful words, the recitation of Qur’an, and holding their tongues back unless it was to speak good of people. 
  They were the trustees (entrusted) by their peoples in (the various) affairs…”</mark></span></p>
<p class="normal-text">After the attempts of Hisham to undermine the Imam’s position utterly failed, Hisham was infuriated. 
  He continued to receive news about the people’s high regard for Imam al-Baqir’s knowledge and virtue… 
  Hisham thus resorted to assassination and had the Holy Imam poisoned. Imam Muhammad al-Baqir was buried in the Baqi’ cemetery of Madinah.</p>

  <h4>The Truthful One</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam al-Baqir, the fifth Imam, once said:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“…This is your Imam after me, so follow his example and benefit from his knowledge. By God, he is al-Sadiq (the Truthful One) – the one whom the Messenger 
    of God (Prophet Muhammad) described to us (in prophecy). Indeed, his followers are aided (by God) in this world and in the Hereafter…”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam al-Baqir was referring to the sixth immaculate Imam – Ja’far al-Sadiq. Under this Imam’s guidance, the Shia school became widely-known. 
    Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq also taught the teachers of various schools of thought which developed in later generations.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq lived in the transition period between the corrupt ‘Umayyad and the tyrannical Abbasid governments. 
    The unique political circumstances at that time helped limit the extent of persecution which the Imam and his followers were subjected to. 
    Thus, Imam al-Sadiq instructed the Shia to take advantage of the situation by increasing their 
    educational and academic activities throughout the Muslim world.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">It was in recognition of this infallible Imam that the term Ja’fari refers to the Shia school of thought. 
    Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq used to tell his companions, 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“When the man among you is conscious in regard to his faith, is honest in his words, delivers the trusts (to their rightful owners),
     perfects his manners with people, it will be said, ‘He is Ja’fari (a follower of Ja’far),’ 
     and that would bring joy to me. But if (the man among you) is (in a condition) other than this, 
     his ordeal and disgrace would (falsely) become attributed to me, when it is said that, ‘these are the manners of Ja’far…’”</mark></span></p>
  <h4>The Sixth Imam</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">During the sixth Imam’s time, various ideologies emerged. 
    While some of these schools remained within the folds of Islam, others were blatantly at odds with core principles of the Islamic faith. 
    But each school had the freedom to make its case and defend its ideas.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">The Islamic university that had been developing during the fifth Imam’s days was now coming to complete fruition with Imam al-Sadiq’s guidance. 
    This great school quickly became the hub of academic discourse for over four thousand students whose thirst for knowledge was quenched by none other than 
    Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq. The sixth Imam’s lessons ranged from the sciences of Qur’an and Prophetic tradition to chemistry, 
    as witnessed by his student and renowned chemist Jabir ibn Hayyan.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">The famous Abu Hanifah, head of the Hanafi School in jurisprudence, used to say,
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“I have not seen (anyone) more knowledgeable than Ja’far, son of Muhammad.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">As another example, Malik, head of the Maliki School in jurisprudence once said:
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“I used to frequent Ja’far, son of Muhammad, for a while – indeed, I did not see him except in one of (these) three conditions: 
    either praying, fasting, or reciting Qur’an. I never saw him narrating on behalf of God’s Messenger 
    (Prophet Muhammad) except in a state of (ritual) purity. He did not speak of that which did not concern him…
    No eye had seen, nor ear had heard, and no heart of mankind had thought of (someone) more virtuous than Ja’far, 
    son of Muhammad, in knowledge, worship, and piety.”</mark></span></p>
  <h4>Proof of the Creator</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">At one point, a man asked Imam al-Sadiq, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“What is the proof that you have a Creator?”</mark></span> Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq responded with the following:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“I found myself subject to one of two options: either I created myself or something other than myself created me. 
    If I created myself, I am also subject to one of two options: either I created my self while my self already existed – 
    but then I would not need to create it since it already existed – or I created my self while I was nonexistent, 
    but you already know that the nonexistent cannot bring about anything. Therefore, the third meaning is proven – that I have a Creator, Who is Lord of the Worlds.”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">This argument leaves no other possible option if one assumes that being created is a given. Another man challenged that thought, however, and told the Imam, 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“I am not a created (being).”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam al-Sadiq said, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Then describe for me – if you were a created (being) – how would you be (what qualities describe a created being)?”</mark></span> 
    The man thought for a while, and then paid attention to a piece of wood that was near him. 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Long, wide, deep, short, moving, stationary…all of these are qualities of being created.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam al-Sadiq then said:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“If you do not know (how to differentiate) qualities of the created (being) as opposed to the not (created being), 
    then consider yourself created due to these things which you see coming about in your own self.”</mark></p>
  <P class="normal-text">In other words, the descriptions of length after being short, of changing width and depth, of motion after stillness, 
    all point to different states of being. Humans are subject to these changes all the time. The next state exists only after the previous one.
    Since change is taking place at every moment, all changing things are essentially being created continuously. Every instant, there is a new proof of us being created.</P>
  <h4>With the Corrupt Ruler</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq had a number of bold confrontations with the corrupt rulers of his day. The Imam stood up and spoke the words of truth without fear or hesitation. 
    One day, the Abbasid ruler Mansur was in the presence of Imam al-Sadiq. Mansur had been shooing away a fly which kept bothering him. As the corrupt ruler became annoyed he asked the Imam, 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“…Why did God create the fly?”</mark></span> Imam al-Sadiq replied, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“To humiliate the arrogant ones.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Mansur remained silent because he knew that, had he spoken, Imam al-Sadiq would have responded with an even more critical statement.  
    But this same ruler chose to write to Imam al-Sadiq one day asking, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Why don’t you approach us as the people approach us?”</mark></span> The Holy Imam answered:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“There is nothing for which we fear you, nor do you have anything of the Hereafter that we would seek you for. 
    Neither are you in a blessing such that we should congratulate you, nor do you see it as a burden such that we should send you our condolences. 
    So what would we do at your place?”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Mansur wrote back, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“You would accompany us to advise us.”</mark></span> Imam al-Sadiq’s response was decisive, 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“The one who wants this world would not advise you, and the one who wants the hereafter would not accompany you.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Mansur soon sought to relieve his worrisome thoughts about Imam al-Sadiq once and for all. The tyrant had the immaculate Imam poisoned in Madinah. 
    On his deathbed, Imam al-Sadiq reminded his followers of an essential duty. The sixth Imam opened his eyes and looked into the faces of those around him saying,</p>
  <p class="normal-text"><span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Indeed, our intercession does not extend to one who takes the prayers lightly.”</mark></span> With these words, 
    Imam al-Sadiq emphasized the significance of prayer and its relation to the intercession of Divine Mercy. The sixth holy Imam was buried in the Baqi’ cemetery of Madinah.</p>

  <h4>The Best of the Best</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">God does not haphazardly choose His representatives. God does not simply choose the oldest son of a prior Imam to be his successor. 
    That would be tantamount to monarchical inheritance, which may or may not elect the most qualified individuals. Rather, God chooses and promotes the best of the best of His creation, 
    in accordance with His comprehensive knowledge of all His creatures.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Granted, it may be that the most righteous humans descended from one family tree, and that may be explained by Divine wisdom. However, 
    the Almighty would only choose His representatives based on the qualities of perfection which He knew of and which manifested through His creation. 
    It has been narrated that the sixth Imam, Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq, advised his close companions with the following:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Treat Musa, this son of mine, well. For indeed, he is the best of my offspring, and the one I leave behind as my successor. 
    After me, he is the one who holds my position and (he is) the proof in support of God – the Glorious and Exalted – (as a witness) upon the entirety of His creation.”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">The sixth Imam distinctly noted that his son, Musa, was the most excellent among his children and the rest of creation. 
    This distinguished feature made Musa, the son of Ja’far, the Divine representative on earth after his father. Musa, the son of Ja’far, was the seventh immaculate Imam.</p>
  <p>Imam Musa continued the noble mission of safeguarding the Truth, in word and action, as did the preceding Imams. 
    However, the oppression of the Abbasid rulers curtailed the Imam’s mobility, placing him in prison for years. For his exceptional endurance, 
    Imam Musa became known as al-Kadhim (the one who holds back his anger and grief).</p>
  <h4>Al-Kadhim: The Seventh Imam</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">After Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq’s passing, the Ja’fari university continued to prosper under the leadership of the seventh Imam, Imam Musa al-Kadhim. 
    Imam Musa was respected for the light of his brilliance as well as the profundity of his character. Scholars of Islam, across the board, have been humbled before Imam Musa’s moral and spiritual standing.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">The well-known Sunni scholar, Ibn Hajar al-Haytami, has written the following in describing the Imam:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Musa al-Kadhim is the inheritor of his father’s knowledge,
    awareness, perfection, and virtue. He was called al-Kadhim for the multitude of his (granted) pardons and his forbearance. 
    He was known amongst the people of Iraq as the ‘door at which God fulfills needs.’ He was the most devout amongst the people of his time; 
    the most knowledgeable and the most generous amongst them.”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">The Holy Imam used to pray at night until sunrise. He would then prostrate, placing his forehead on the ground out of humility before God – 
    sometimes not lifting his head off the ground until just before noon. This Divine representative used to tremble and cry due to his intense awareness of God, 
    such that his beard would become drenched with his tears.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam al-Kadhim was unique in the extent to which he maintained positive relations with his family and relatives. 
    The Imam’s kindness also extended to his neighbors, both near and far. The poor of Madinah used to enjoy the fruits of Imam al-Kadhim’s generosity, 
    not knowing that the Imam had been their secret benefactor. But even in light of these incredible traits, Imam Musa al-Kadhim used to pray, 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Immense is the fault of your servant, so beautiful let the pardon be from You.”</mark></span></p>
  <h4>Participation for Preservation</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">The Abbasid rule of Harun al-Rashid was tainted by the persecution and bloodshed of the innocent. 
    Although Harun used to display the outward appearance of a pious Muslim, he often contradicted that guise when he lavishly spent money from the Muslim treasury to satisfy his personal desires and whims. 
    While he would cry and faint after hearing a religious sermon, he also kept one thousand servant girls, three hundred of whom specialized in singing and dancing for him.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam Musa al-Kadhim knew that an important way to help curtail the injustice of Harun’s regime was to have some of his loyal supporters play important roles in the administration. 
    The seventh Imam urged some of his key students to participate in Harun’s government, as long as the participant worked to preserve the lives and protect the rights of the innocent – especially the oppressed Shia. 
    For instance, the Imam’s devout companion, ‘Ali ibn Yaqṭin, sought permission from the Imam to undertake a high-profile position in Harun’s government. Imam al-Kadhim permitted him and explained:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Indeed, with you we find joy and your brothers gain pride; perhaps through you God will mend that which is broken and through you He will break the hostile 
    (will) of those opposing His allies.”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">When ‘Ali ibn Yaqṭin complained to Imam al-Kadhim about the difficult conditions surrounding his work in Harun’s ministry, the Imam said:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“O ‘Ali, indeed God has allies who are in the company of the allies of the oppressors, in order to push (harm) away from His allies – and you are among them, O ‘Ali.”</mark></p>
  <h4>Returning Fadak</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">One day, Harun tried to gauge Imam al-Kadhim’s thoughts regarding the Abbasid political rule. In his attempt, Harun expressed his willingness to return the land of Fadak – which was 
    usurped from Lady Zahra’, along with the political leadership, after the Prophet’s passing – to its rightful owners. The Holy Imam responded with the following:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“I would not take it unless (it is returned) with its (true) boundaries.”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Harun then inquired, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“And what are its boundaries?”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam al-Kadhim answered, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“If I specify the boundaries, you will not return it.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">When Harun insisted adamantly, Imam Musa al-Kadhim declared the boundaries which expressed the true meaning behind the idea of Fadak:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“As for the first boundary, it is Aden (the southern edge of the nation). The second boundary is Samarqand (the eastern edge of the nation). 
    The third boundary is Africa (the western edge of the nation). As for the fourth boundary, it is at the coast beyond (the land of) the Khazars and Armenia (the northern edge of the nation).”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Harun became more furious as the Imam listed each successive boundary, until he finally exclaimed with a mixture of sadness and anger, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“So nothing is left for us!”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Seizing Fadak meant turning one’s back on God’s commands. Returning Fadak would mean an end to corrupt rule and accepting the political leadership prescribed by Allah (swt). But Harun could not bring himself to give up the usurped throne</p>
  <h4>Imprisonment and Martyrdom</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">Historians are in agreement that Harun imprisoned Imam al-Kadhim for several years because he feared that the Imam would incite people against him. 
    The seventh Imam was transferred from the darkness of one prison to another and subjected to very harsh conditions. Still, the Imam always viewed the situation positively and prayed frequently:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“O God, I always used to ask You to free me (from other duties) in order to worship You; and You have answered me, so thanks be unto You for doing so.”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Harun ultimately decided to murder the seventh Imam. The corrupt ruler ordered the prison warden to poison Imam al-Kadhim. In order to cover up his heinous act, 
    Harun called upon the scholars of his court, as well as the distinguished personalities of Baghdad, to witness that the Imam was apparently healthy. But Imam al-Kadhim realized this, turned to those present, and said:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Witness that I have been killed by poison. For three days, witness that I have appeared healthy on the outside, but I have been poisoned…”</mark></p>
  <p class="normal-text">The Holy Imam predicted that he would be martyred after three days, and so he was. Imam al-Kadhim was buried in the Quraysh cemetery of Baghdad, which is now known as Kadhimiyyah</p>

  <h3>Words of Wisdom from Imam al-Rida (p)</h3>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Worship is not in plentiful fasting and prayers, but rather it is in plentiful contemplation of God’s [signs].”</mark></p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Faith has four pillars: entrusting oneself to God, contentment in God’s decree, submission to God, and conferring ourselves to God.”</mark></p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“Endearment to others is half of intellect.”</mark></p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“The servant [of God] has not perfected his\her faith until they have three qualities: understanding of their religion, good management over their lifestyle, and patience during tribulation.”</mark></p>
  <h3>Salient Features of the Imam’s Life</h3>
  <h4> 1 – Appointment of Imamate</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">In Shia Islamic theology, an important factor in determining the next Imam is nass, or evidence suggesting that the previous Imam clearly appointed the following representative. 
    And there is significant evidence to suggest the appointment of Imam Ali al-Rida (p), by his father, the seventh imam, Imam Musa al-Kazim (p).</p>
  <p class="normal-text">A man by the name of Sulayman narrated the following regarding his meeting with Imam al-Kadhim before the Holy Imam had been poisoned:</p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“I wanted to ask (Imam al-Kazim) about the proof (the Imam in support of God as a witness) upon the people after him. Then he started (saying):</mark></p>
  <p class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">‘O Sulayman, indeed, ‘Ali is my son, my guardian, and the proof (in support of) God (as a witness) upon the people after me. 
    He is the best of my offspring. So, if you remain (living) after me, then be a witness of that for him (in the presence of) my Shia, the people (pledging) allegiance to me, and those asking about (who) my successor is.”</mark></p>
  <h4>2 – The Imam in Khorasan</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">After Imam Musa al-Kadhim was martyred and people learned that Harun al-Rashid had been the culprit, the corrupt ruler eased the pressure on the Shia for the remainder of his reign so as not further to incite a rebellion. 
    So, at least for a while, Imam al-Kadhim’s successor was free to teach and speak publicly. </p>
  <p class="normal-text">Conflict within the Abbasid government and a host of historical events led Ma’mun, (the son of Harun), into power, and the eighth Imam was then catapulted into mounting political pressure. 
    Ma’mun thought up a plan to neutralize the growing threat of a Shia rebellion and kept tabs on the Shia leadership. To gain legitimacy, Ma’mun forced Imam al-Rida (p) 
    to reside at his palace in Marv, the capital of Khorasan (in modern-day Turkmenistan).</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam al-Rida, realizing Ma’mun intentions, initially rejected the invitation. But after Ma’mun insistence and threats, the Imam was escorted to Ma’mun palace.</p>
  <p>At Ma’mun’s headquarters, the remainder of the corrupt ruler’s plot unfolded. Ma’mun offered to step down from his political role and accept the leadership of Imam al-Rida. 
    Imam al-Rida turned down the offer because he knew Ma’mun was insincere. Ma’mun then suggested that the Imam accept the position of Wilayat al- ‘Ahd (being successor or crown prince), as if Abbasid rule had been legitimate to begin with.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam al-Rida refused to accept. But Ma’mun could not accept the Imam’s rejection. He threatened to kill him. Even then, the Holy Imam only accepted the title which Ma’mun proposed, 
    after making it clear that he would effectively have no role in Ma’mun’s corrupt government.6 The Imam attempted to utilize the opportunity at hand to serve and advance the cause of the Shia community. </p>
  <h4>3 – The Imam’s Debates with Other Faith Leaders</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">Ma’mun called upon scholars of various ideologies, both within Islam and beyond, in an attempt to stump Imam al-Rida intellectually. 
    The eighth Imam, however, stood before the winds of doubt like an unshakeable mountain of certainty. Imam al-Rida was like a light that shone in every dialogue and debate as an unsurpassed source of guidance.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">With every discussion, with every scholar, and with every opposing idea, the Imam’s wise and refined thoughts made him even more revered and loved.</p>
  <p class="normal-text+">In one of the debates with Christian scholars, the Imam reached a point where he said, 
    <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“By God, we believe in the Jesus who believed in Muhammad, and we don’t blame your Jesus except for his weakness and the lack of his fasting and prayer.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">The Imam said, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“And how is that?”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">Jathliq replied, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“You said that Jesus was weak, lacking in his fasting, and lacking in his prayer, when Jesus did not break his fast on any day at all, 
    nor did he sleep at night at all, but rather he fasted throughout (his) time and stayed up in worship at night.”</mark></span></p>
  <p class="normal-text">The Imam replied, implicitly clarifying his initial statement, <span class="italics"><mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">“So (if you say Jesus is God, then) whom did he fast for and pray to?”</mark></span></p>
  <h4>4 – The Imam’s Martyrdom & Legacy</h4>
  <p class="normal-text">The Imam (p) made every attempt to continue to preach the message of his forefathers, in spite of the circumstances of living under the watchful eye of the Abbasid authorities. 
    His leadership, gentleness, and knowledge made him popular across the Muslim world, leading to Ma’mun’s fear that his strategy would backfire. What magnified Ma’mun’s worries was 
    the revolt of some Abbasids back in the traditional capital – Baghdad – against him. These factors led Ma’mun to a decision to rid himself of his worry. 
    Thus, the Abbasid ruler Ma’mun decided to have the holy eighth Imam poisoned.</p>
  <p class="normal-text">Imam ‘Ali al-Rida was buried in Tus, present-day Mashhad, Iran. The Imam’s legacy is in the heart of those who love, adore, 
    and visit his mausoleum to which millions of devotees flock every year. In addition, his ethical and spiritual traditions, along with his 
    jurisprudential wisdom, are present in the textbooks and classical hadith works of the Shia community. </p>
